                    I've been staying true to my desire to spend less time on less productive things. It's actually kind of suprising just how much time we waist. I've probably been spending at least 2 hours a day working on my website and just learning web development. That is on top of the fact that I have a full time job, I'm in full time college, and I have a 2 year old son. I also find 3 days a week to get myself to a gym. Even with all that stuff going on I still manage to find time to play video games and watch TV.

                    I'm still very motivated to getting my website up and starting a consulting business. As with most things it seems the more I learn about starting a business and development in general the more questions I have. I'm learning really quicly my website is coming a long way, I'm starting to get the front end to a point that I'm happy with, I'm still learning on how to integrate everything back to a database for saving profile informaiton. I'm hoping to have it hosted so it's at least visible to the world soon. More to come!
