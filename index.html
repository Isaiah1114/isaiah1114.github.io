                   This past week I had final exams to do for my second semester of collage. I Did great on my exams but the study time took a little bit of time away from my ability to invest time into my website. I have found however a means to monotize my efforts. I may be one of the last to find out about this but turns out, alot of places have Affiliate programs like amazon where you can make a commission off of driving business to other peoples products. That's good news because it looks like it'll be alot easier to monotize than I initally thought.

                    One thing I'm learning from this experience is that nothing is ever as complicated as it first seems. This entire process felt impossible, expecially with everything I had going on but now I'm neck deep in everything and it's starting to seem easier and easier by the day, I still have yet to make any money for teh effort I'm putting in and I spend a decent amount on forming a business and classes but I'm hoping to start having a small passive income soon.

                    If you find this helpful or interesting, support a fellow entrepreneur and buy this super dope keyboard. I actually bought it myself earlier today because I don't want to tell anybody to buy anything I wouldn't buy myself.
