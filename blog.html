                    One of my big weaknesses has always been my ability to see something to completion. I tend to get things about 90% of the way, then get bored and start on something new. This is a horrible way to handle things because you end wasting a bunch of time on things that never get to a position to where you can make profit. As you may have noticed, The blog is now integrated into a web project I'm working on Code and Cars. I did this to just get this project shipped before I give myself the chance to forget about it.

                    There is obviously still a lot of work needed on the web site but having it posted will keep engaged with it. also, theres potential of making income now where there wouldn't be if i spent another few weeks perfecting it before shipping it.

                    I created code and cars based on my own interests but I think there's potential behind it. I do know that most successful endeavors are kept as simple as possible and combining multiple demographics tends to target less people but in my experience, Developers love Cars and car guys love troubleshooting so they're very relatable and I believe others will agree. Also there's a million dev channels and 2 million car channels so I'm trying to do something a little different.
