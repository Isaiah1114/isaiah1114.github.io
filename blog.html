                    I've either painted or plasti dipped the rims on just about every car Iâ€™ve owned. You can find a couple cars on this sites Instagram page showing the before and after of the rims I painted. This post is going out outline my method and some tricks I use to get the best result. People will tend to avoid plasti dip because it's got a reputation for being temporary. However, when done right, plasti dip can last for over 2 years without having any issues. I also see the temporary aspect as being a good thing. I tend to trade cars in often and painted rims will cost you a couple grand on the trade it. I'd rather just peal the paint and pocked the money given the option.

                    The first step to get a good result with Plasti Dip is to remove the rim. it is not a lot of extra work and you really get a much better result this way and it's a lot easier to avoid overspray getting on you or your neighbors car. I also find it a lot easier than trying to tape off the entire car and caliper to avoid getting paint on them.

                    I typically do this in a garage so the wind and dust is a little bit more controlled. You'll want to clean the rim really well with something that is going to remove all the grease and debris from the wheel so the plasti dip adheres in a desired manner. I use acetone if possible but alcohol will also work. Next, you will want to tape off the rims. My favorite way to tape off the rim is to simply use sticky notes. they are cheap and really easy to put in place under the lip of the rim to avoid paint getting on the tire.

                    now you are ready to paint. If you're new to painting with spray cans, you may want to look up a video but I'll give a description anyways. You want to paint in short, controlled streaks, if you hold the nozzle down you're more likely to get build up which can drip and look horrible. You'll also want to start the spay off of the rim and move onto the rim for each streak. Sometimes the paint can build up in the nozzle between coats and when you spray it, it could shoot the debris onto  your rim. Luckily with Plasti Dip you can always peal it back off and start again but it's better not to have to do that if you can avoid it. You'll want to apply many thin coats but you'll also want it to build up to ultimately be pretty thick. This both prevents it from easily taking damage and pealing off, but also it makes it ALOT easier to take off when you're ready.

                    Once that's complete, the kit I recommend also comes with a can of clear coat. To apply clear coat is very similar to how you apply the paint with one main importance. You want to make sure you get even coverage across the rim. The easiest way to do this in my opinion is to do complete horizontal passes with the next pass having a 50% coverage on the area of the last pass. Again this may be easier to understand if you watch a video but if you follow the instruction on the can, they typically steer you in the right direction.

                    with paint you'll need to let these sit overnight to cure, plasti dip dries a lot quicker though I usually just let them sit in the sun for a couple hours and they're dry enough to handle. Now you can experience the significant amount of character you just gave your car with about half
