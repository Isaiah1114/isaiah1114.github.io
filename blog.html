                    I am not going to lie; I have been slacking pretty hard this week. I have only made a couple posts on my Instagram and have not made any updates to my website. I have been super busy this week because my third semester at school started up and there were a lot of startup projects and stuff I had to do. Starting a website and a following by yourself is very difficult and getting other people on board to help seems to be equally difficult.

                    One thing I plan to do is start selling merchandise though. My goal for my website and Instagram following is to develop a brand around it. I think having a tangible item that drives people to my online store will be go along way and help keep me motivated to keep up with the website. That is not easy either, there is a decent amount of startup cost associated with selling t-shirts or other similar items. Not to mention creating them is a bit of a skill so that is more that I need to learn. There is a reason most successful companies start as partnerships and I am totally seeing why.
