                    I want to become a millionare! The purpouse of this Blog is to talkabout myself and log my adventure as I work to lift my family out of the every day rat race. As a second purpuse I hope to inspire others to go after their drams similar to how I'm doing now.

                    I'm no writer so this may not be the most gramatically correct article but I
                    figured building a website can be beneficial. for starters, I can keep track
                    of my own progress and keep myself honest on whether or not I'm keeping to
                    my goals. Also if by some stroke of luck this article develops a following,
                    you readers can keep my honest as well. This would also prove as a good 
                    starter project to learn how to build and host and manage a website. As a
                    plus, if i log enough information and make something out of myself I could
                    later turn it into a book and monotize that as well. I would obviously have
                    to be succesful for that though.

                    I recently watched a youtuber who talked about forming good habits as well
                    as other things are important to become hyper successful. These videos
                    inspired me to push myself to start taking action rather than just having
                    ideas in the shower. I probably spend 4 plus hours a day watching TV or
                    Playing video games and I'd rather be spending that time more productivly.

                    My goal is to make a website for myself to sell video game assets. Once that
                    is complete my current goal is to branch into being a consultant, working 
                    for myself, building websites for others. My resume isn't super impressive 
                    at the moment, i've been in IT for about 8 years and have been a JR software 
                    developer for a little over a year now. I recently got a promotion to 
                    regular software developer but my responsabilites are the same. I'm 
                    currently about to finish my second semester in college but I have no 
                    special training or anything.

                    I Plan to update this blog post once a week. Most my posts probably wont be 
                    this long but I hope for it to keep me honest and possibly inspire others. 
                    They say to expect to fail on your first 3+ attemps so lets get started!
