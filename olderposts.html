                   This past week I had final exams to do for my second semester of collage. I Did great on my exams but the study time took a little bit of time away from my ability to invest time into my website. I have found however a means to monotize my efforts. I may be one of the last to find out about this but turns out, alot of places have Affiliate programs like amazon where you can make a commission off of driving business to other peoples products. That's good news because it looks like it'll be alot easier to monotize than I initally thought.

                    One thing I'm learning from this experience is that nothing is ever as complicated as it first seems. This entire process felt impossible, expecially with everything I had going on but now I'm neck deep in everything and it's starting to seem easier and easier by the day, I still have yet to make any money for the effort I'm putting in and I spend a decent amount on forming a business and classes but I'm hoping to start having a small passive income soon.

                    If you find this helpful or interesting, support a fellow entrepreneur and buy this super dope keyboard. I actually bought it myself earlier today because I don't want to tell anybody to buy anything I wouldn't buy myself.

                    I've been staying true to my desire to spend less time on less productive things. It's actually kind of suprising just how much time we waist. I've probably been spending at least 2 hours a day working on my website and just learning web development. That is on top of the fact that I have a full time job, I'm in full time college, and I have a 2 year old son. I also find 3 days a week to get myself to a gym. Even with all that stuff going on I still manage to find time to play video games and watch TV. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm still very motivated to getting my website up and starting a consulting business. As with most things it seems the more I learn about starting a business and development in general the more questions I have. I'm learning really quicly my website is coming a long way, I'm starting to get the front end to a point that I'm happy with, I'm still learning on how to integrate everything back to a database for saving profile informaiton. I'm hoping to have it hosted so it's at least visible to the world soon. More to come!

                    I want to become a millionare! The purpouse of this Blog is to talkabout myself and log my adventure as I work to lift my family out of the every day rat race. As a second purpuse I hope to inspire others to go after their drams similar to how I'm doing now.

                    I'm no writer so this may not be the most gramatically correct article but I
                    figured building a website can be beneficial. for starters, I can keep track
                    of my own progress and keep myself honest on whether or not I'm keeping to
                    my goals. Also if by some stroke of luck this article develops a following,
                    you readers can keep my honest as well. This would also prove as a good 
                    starter project to learn how to build and host and manage a website. As a
                    plus, if i log enough information and make something out of myself I could
                    later turn it into a book and monotize that as well. I would obviously have
                    to be succesful for that though.

                    I recently watched a youtuber who talked about forming good habits as well
                    as other things are important to become hyper successful. These videos
                    inspired me to push myself to start taking action rather than just having
                    ideas in the shower. I probably spend 4 plus hours a day watching TV or
                    Playing video games and I'd rather be spending that time more productivly.

                    <br>
                    My goal is to make a website for myself to sell video game assets. Once that
                    is complete my current goal is to branch into being a consultant, working 
                    for myself, building websites for others. My resume isn't super impressive 
                    at the moment, i've been in IT for about 8 years and have been a JR software 
                    developer for a little over a year now. I recently got a promotion to 
                    regular software developer but my responsabilites are the same. I'm 
                    currently about to finish my second semester in college but I have no 
                    special training or anything.

                    I Plan to update this blog post once a week. Most my posts probably wont be 
                    this long but I hope for it to keep me honest and possibly inspire others. 
                    They say to expect to fail on your first 3+ attemps so lets get started!
