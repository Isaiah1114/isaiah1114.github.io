            <h1>We Love to Code</h1>
            <h1>We Love Cars</h1>
            <p>Tech companies and Car manufactures are slowly starting to become one in the same. All the major tech companies are trying to get in the car game and all the large car manufactures are trying to apply more tech to their lineup. With self driving electric car on the horizen it's only a matter of time until programmers become the mechanics. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We beleive this to be a pretty natural transition however because software developers very often also love cars. The point of Code and Cars is to capture both the interest to crate and troubleshoot applications, websites and video games and combine that with the love of going 100 miles an hour in a big piece of metal.
            <br>
            <br>
            Both developers and car enthusiests love to create things that express themselves and show off thri talent and creativity through public mediums. Also we both enjoy spending time on advanced troublshooting with intense satisfaction from overcoming mentally challenging dilemas.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a place where you can find both and drive enthusiasm towards combining some potentially really cool future tech into an old muscle car creating a new retro world of cars. Or you can just stop at one place to get some interesting content on either.
